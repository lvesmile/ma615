26135 "Children had been sent off to Sunday school, and the more conscientious"
26135 "reached that destination; going in, after delivering awful threats and"
26135 "warnings to those who preferred freedom of thought and a stroll down"
26135 "Edgware Road in the direction of the Park.  As a consequence, in the"
26135 "streets off the main thoroughfare leading to Paddington Station peace"
26135 "and silence existed, broken only by folk who, after the principal meal"
26135 "of the week, talked in their sleep.  Praed Street was different.  Praed"
26135 "Street plumed itself on the fact that it was always lively, ever on the"
26135 "move, occasionally acquainted with royalty.  Even on a Sunday"
26135 "afternoon, and certainly at all hours of a week-day, one could look"
26135 "from windows at good racing, generally done by folk impeded by hand"
26135 "luggage who, as they ran, glanced suspiciously at every clock, and"
26135 "gasped, in a despairing way, \"We shall never do it!\" or,"
26135 "optimistically, \"We shall only just do it!\" or, with resignation,"
26135 "\"Well, if we lose this one we shall have to wait for the next.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Few establishments were open in Praed Street, shutters were up at the"
26135 "numerous second-hand shops, and at the hour of three o'clock p.m. the"
26135 "thirst for journals at E. G. Mills's (Established 1875) was satisfied;"
26135 "the appetite for cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco had scarcely begun."
26135 "Now and again a couple of boys, who had been reading stories of wild"
26135 "adventure in the Rocky Mountains, dashed across the road, upset one of"
26135 "Mrs. Mills's placard boards, and flew in opposite directions, feeling"
26135 "that although they might not have equalled the daring exploits of their"
26135 "heroes in fiction, they had gone as far as was possible in a country"
26135 "hampered by civilization."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Young rascals!\" said Mrs. Mills, coming back after repairing one of"
26135 "these outrages.  The shop had a soft, pleasing scent of tobacco from"
26135 "the brown jars, marked in gilded letters \"Bird's Eye\" and \"Shag\" and"
26135 "\"Cavendish,\" together with the acrid perfume of printer's ink.  \"Still,"
26135 "I suppose we were all young once.  Gertie,\" raising her voice, \"isn't"
26135 "it about time you popped upstairs to make yourself good-looking?"
26135 "There's no cake in the house, and that always means some one looks in"
26135 "unexpectedly to tea.\""
26135 ""
26135 "No answer."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Gertie!  Don't you hear me when I'm speaking to you?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Beg pardon, aunt.  I was thinking of something else.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You think too much of something else, my dear,\" said Mrs. Mills"
26135 "persuasively.  \"I was saying to a customer, only yesterday, that you"
26135 "don't seem able lately to throw off your work when you've finished."
26135 "You keep on threshing it out in your mind.  And it's all very well, to"
26135 "a certain extent, but there's a medium in all things.\"  Mrs. Mills went"
26135 "to the half-open door, that was curtained only in regard to the lower"
26135 "portion.  \"Trimming a hat,\" she cried protestingly.  \"Oh, my dear, and"
26135 "to think your mother was a Wesleyan Methodist.  Before she came to"
26135 "London, I mean.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Her niece surveyed the work at arm's length.  \"I've done all I want to"
26135 "do to it,\" she said."
26135 ""
26135 "Mrs. Mills ordered the hat to be put on that she might ascertain"
26135 "whether it suited, and this done, and guarded approval given, asked to"
26135 "be allowed to try it on her own head.  Here, again, the results,"
26135 "inspected in the large mirror set in a narrow wooden frame above the"
26135 "mantelpiece, gained commendation; Mrs. Mills declared she would feel"
26135 "inclined to purchase a similar hat, only that Praed Street might say"
26135 "she was looking for a second husband.  Besides, she never went out."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Your poor mother was just as handy with her needle as what you are."
26135 "We'd go along together to have a look at the shops in Oxford Street,"
26135 "and the moment she returned home, she'd set to work, and alter"
26135 "something to make it look fashionable.\" Mrs. Mills sighed.  \"Little"
26135 "good it brought her, though, in the long run.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I am sure,\" remarked the girl quickly, \"it never brought her any harm.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Didn't help to get hold of anybody better than your father, at any"
26135 "rate.  But they're both gone, and it's no use talking.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Some one entered the shop."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Your friend Miss Radford,\" she announced.  \"Now there won't be a"
26135 "chance for any one else to speak.\""
26135 ""
26135 "The visitor justified the prophecy, by entering the parlour with a"
26135 "breathless \"Oh, I've got such news!\" checking herself on encountering"
26135 "Mrs. Mills.  Mrs. Mills asked, with reserve, concerning the health of"
26135 "Miss Radford's mother, and mentioned (not apparently for the first"
26135 "time) that the lady, in her opinion, ought to be living on a gravel"
26135 "soil.  Miss Radford, obviously suffering from repressed information,"
26135 "promised to deliver the advice, word for word, and in the meantime gave"
26135 "her own warm thanks."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Old nuisance!\" she remarked, as the half-curtained door closed.  \"I"
26135 "wonder how you can put up with her.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"My aunt is very good to me.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Isn't it a pity,\" said the visitor inconsequently, \"that you're so"
26135 "short?  Well, not exactly short, but certainly only about middle"
26135 "height.  I think\"--she glanced at the mirror complacently--\"my idea is"
26135 "it's partly because I'm tall that I attract so much notice.  I'm sure"
26135 "the way they gaze round after I'm gone by--Well, it used to make me"
26135 "feel quite confused, but I've got over that.  You don't have to put up"
26135 "with such experiences, Gertie.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Afraid I forget to turn to see if they're looking.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You've got rather a thoughtless disposition,\" agreed the other.  \"Once"
26135 "or twice lately, when I've been telling you things that I don't tell to"
26135 "everybody, it's struck me that you've been scarcely listening.\"  The"
26135 "door was closed, but Miss Radford verified this before proceeding."
26135 "\"What do you think?\" she asked in an awed voice.  \"Whatever do you"
26135 "think?  Two of my old ones have met.  Met at a smoking concert"
26135 "apparently.  And they somehow started talking, and my name cropped up,"
26135 "and,\" tearfully, \"they've written me such a unkind letter, with both"
26135 "their names to it.  On the top of it all, the latest one caught sight"
26135 "of me yesterday afternoon, dressing the window at our establishment, so"
26135 "that he won't put in an appearance at the Marble Arch this evening.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Why not?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Because I told him I was an artist.  Said I had a picture in the Royal"
26135 "Academy the year before last.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You are rather foolish at times, aren't you?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I wish, darling,\" wailed Miss Radford, \"that you could tell me"
26135 "something I don't know.\""
26135 ""
26135 "The clock on the mantelpiece struck the half-hour, and Mrs. Mills's"
26135 "niece, suddenly alarmed, said she would not be absent for more than ten"
26135 "minutes, an announcement the visitor received with an incredulous shake"
26135 "of the head.  As a fact, Gertie returned in five minutes fully"
26135 "apparelled, to discover Miss Radford improved in spirits and ready for"
26135 "more conversation."
26135 ""
26135 "\"A new blouse?\" she cried, interrupting herself.  \"And you never told"
26135 "me.  Gertie Higham,\" solemnly, \"this isn't what I call friendship.\""
26135 ""
26135 "The girl went straight through the shop, and looking up and down Praed"
26135 "Street, remarked to Mrs. Mills that it intended to be a fine evening."
26135 "The elder lady said it was high time Gertie found a young man to take"
26135 "her out; the girl answered composedly that perhaps Mr. Trew might call"
26135 "and do her this service."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Or Fred Bulpert?\" remarked the aunt pointedly."
26135 ""
26135 "\"No,\" she answered, \"not Mr. Bulpert, thank you.  Mr. Trew is"
26135 "different.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"He isn't the man he was when I first knew him.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I like him because he's the man he is.\""
26135 ""
26135 "She turned quickly at the sound of a deep, husky voice.  Mr. Trew, on"
26135 "the mat, opened his arms at sight of her, and beamed with a face that"
26135 "was like the midday sun; she took his sleeve and pulled him to the"
26135 "pavement."
26135 ""
26135 "\"At five minutes to five,\" she whispered urgently, \"you're going to"
26135 "take me for a walk in Hyde Park.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"At four fifty-five to the minute,\" he agreed.  \"What's the game, may I"
26135 "kindly ask?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I'll tell you later on.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I hadn't noticed it,\" he said loudly, re-entering the shop, \"until my"
26135 "attention was drawed to it by the little missy here.  But there it is"
26135 "right enough on the playcards.  'Motor omnibuses for London.'\"  He"
26135 "shook his head, and, leaning across the counter, addressed Mrs. Mills."
26135 "\"Light of my life, sunshine of my existence--\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Don't you begin your nonsense,\" ordered the lady, not displeased."
26135 ""
26135 "\"--And sweetheart when a boy, I warn you against putting any of your"
26135 "ill-gotten gains into that sort of speculation.  They may perhaps start"
26135 "one from the Elephant and it'll get about as fur as the Obelisk, and"
26135 "there it'll stick.  And they'll have to take it to pieces, and sell it"
26135 "for scrap iron.  I know what I'm talking about.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"That's unusual in your case,\" said Mrs. Mills."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I get light-headed when I see you,\" explained Mr. Trew.  \"I was took"
26135 "like it the first time I ran across you up in the gallery of the old"
26135 "Princess's, seeing 'Guinea Gold,' and you've had the same effect on me"
26135 "ever since.  What's more, you glory in it.  You're proud of the"
26135 "wonderful influence you exercise over me.  And all I get out of you is"
26135 "a 'aughty smile.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"The fact is,\" declared Mrs. Mills, \"you get too much attention from"
26135 "the ladies.  It spoils you!\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"See how she spurns me,\" he cried, turning to Gertie.  \"You wouldn't"
26135 "treat a gentleman like that, would you, missy?  You wouldn't play"
26135 "football with an honest, loving heart, I'm sure.  Oh, come on,\" with"
26135 "pretended desperation, \"let's have a cigar, and try to forget all about"
26135 "it.  A twopenny one; same as you sell to members of the House of Lords.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You're staying to tea,\" suggested Mrs. Mills, allowing him to make a"
26135 "selection from a box."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I've got to leave just before five o'clock.  Going to take the little"
26135 "missy here out for a promenade.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Now that is kind and thoughtful of you,\" declared the other.  \"With"
26135 "all your silliness, you're not half a bad sort.  Gertie, go in and lay"
26135 "the table.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Miss Radford, after inspecting the new-comer over the half-curtain,"
26135 "decided to leave, although, as she pointed out, this was an opportunity"
26135 "for enjoying her company that rarely occurred.  In confidence, the"
26135 "young woman remarked that what she hoped might happen at a future date"
26135 "was that she would meet some one possessing a disengaged brother, in"
26135 "which case she guaranteed to bring all her influence to bear in favour"
26135 "of Gertie Higham.  Gertie said this was kind, and Miss Radford"
26135 "mentioned that she always felt ready to do a favour whenever she"
26135 "happened to be in good spirits."
26135 ""
26135 "The three sat at table, with Mrs. Mills in a position that commanded a"
26135 "view of the shop.  Mr. Trew had brought a bag of prawns in the"
26135 "tail-pocket of his coat, secured, he asserted, after enormous trouble"
26135 "and expense from the sea coast of Marylebone Road that very afternoon;"
26135 "they were, anyway, good prawns, and went admirably with thin bread and"
26135 "butter, and Gertie would have eaten more but for anxiety concerning"
26135 "progress of the hands of the clock.  Mr. Trew, discussing the products"
26135 "of the sea, regretted that he was bound, by his work, to London--"
26135 ""
26135 "\"Horses is my occupation,\" he said, \"but the ocean's my hobby.\""
26135 ""
26135 "--And derided town, charging it with stuffiness in this month of"
26135 "August, and moreover empty.  He wished he were on the pier at Southend,"
26135 "or at Margate, or at any place, in fact, where he might see the waves"
26135 "rolling in and rolling out again, and shy pebbles at them."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Gertie could have had her holiday this month,\" remarked Mrs. Mills,"
26135 "glancing with pride at her niece, \"but she preferred not.  I don't feel"
26135 "sure whether she did right or whether she did wrong in giving them up."
26135 "There's more unlikely places than a seaside boarding-house to pick up a"
26135 "future husband.\"  She gave details of a case of a young woman living in"
26135 "Harrow Road, who, in the summer of 1900, met at Eastbourne a gentleman"
26135 "with one arm, invalided home from the war; an engagement immediately"
26135 "followed.  Later, the girl discovered he was already married, and that"
26135 "he had gone away from his wife and children, taking with him the"
26135 "compensation given to him by his employers, a firm of builders at"
26135 "Willesden."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I expect the missy is keeping her eyes open, if the truth was known.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"But no definite results,\" contended Mrs. Mills.  \"That's what I"
26135 "complain of.  At her age I had three after me.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"This was long before I came on the scene,\" explained Mr. Trew to"
26135 "Gertie; \"otherwise there would have been bloodshed.  Is this meal _ad"
26135 "lib._, or do I have to pay extra for another cup of tea?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I don't want her to worry about it; I only want her to keep it in"
26135 "view.  What I should like more than anything would be to see a young"
26135 "man who was fond of her come in here, at a time like this, and take his"
26135 "piece of bread and butter, fold it, enjoy it, and sing to us"
26135 "afterwards.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You're certain about that, aunt?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Providing he had a decent voice.\"  The shop bell rang.  Mrs. Mills"
26135 "half rose and recognized the customer.  \"We are now about to get all"
26135 "the news of the neighbourhood,\" she said desolately."
26135 ""
26135 "Gertie anticipated her, and, going in, served the lady with a copy of"
26135 "_Fireside Love Stories_.  Returned with an imperative message."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I shall have to see her,\" admitted Mrs. Mills.  \"She won't be happy"
26135 "until she gets some piece of scandal off her mind.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Fair one,\" said Trew, with a wave of his hand, \"every moment will seem"
26135 "like a century until you return!\""
26135 ""
26135 "Gertie was fixing her newly-trimmed hat with the aid of the mirror, and"
26135 "Mr. Trew was describing an accident witnessed the day before near Hyde"
26135 "Park corner, when sound of commotion came from the street; he seized"
26135 "his peaked cap and hurried through the shop.  Gertie followed."
26135 "Conversation between the two ladies had been interrupted by the same"
26135 "cause and they were outside the doorway, looking on at a small crowd"
26135 "that acted as escort to an ambulance in charge of two policemen; the"
26135 "aim of every one appeared to be to snatch the privilege of securing a"
26135 "view of the man partly hidden by the brown hood of the conveyance."
26135 "Mrs. Mills sent the customer across to obtain particulars, and"
26135 "remarking cheerfully to Mr. Trew and the girl, \"You two off?  Don't be"
26135 "late back, mind!\" turned to the more interesting subject.  Children"
26135 "were running up from side streets, grateful for anything likely to"
26135 "break the serenity of the afternoon."
26135 ""
26135 "\"If he's damaged hisself,\" said Mr. Trew, as the ambulance stopped at"
26135 "the hospital, \"he's going to the right place to get repaired.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"It's to be hoped he has friends.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Everybody's got the friends they deserve to have.  Are we going the"
26135 "direction to suit you, missy, or would you rather have gone Edgware"
26135 "Road way?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Let's turn down London Street,\" she suggested.  \"It will be quiet"
26135 "there.  I've something to tell you.\"  She rolled her parasol carefully."
26135 "\"And I want your help, Mr. Trew.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Three youths near the underground station, with apparently no urgent"
26135 "occupation, came forward hopefully on seeing Gertie; detecting the fact"
26135 "that she was in the company of a big, burly man, they had to pretend a"
26135 "sudden interest in a shuttered window.  The two, going into Norfolk"
26135 "Square, walked on the narrow pavement near the railings of the garden."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Mr. Trew, I've got a young man!\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"That's the best news,\" he exclaimed heartily, \"I've heard this summer!\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"And I want somehow to get him asked indoors.  Once aunt sees him and"
26135 "hears him talk, it will be all right.  But I'm nervous about it, and I"
26135 "don't know how to manage.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"This,\" he said, holding up a forefinger, \"is just where old Harry Trew"
26135 "comes in.  This is exactly the sort of job he's fitted for.  If he"
26135 "hadn't took up with another occupation he'd have found himself by this"
26135 "time in the Foreign Office.  Do you want it arranged for to-night?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Please!\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Right you are!  You're going to meet him, I take it, presently.  You"
26135 "asked me to come out with you simply as an excuse for that purpose."
26135 "Very well, then.  I've got a standing invite, as you very well know, to"
26135 "drop in at the nine o'clock meal any Sunday evening I like.  Your aunt"
26135 "expects me.\"  The forefinger became emphatic.  \"You simply arrange for"
26135 "him to meet me, say, outside the Met. at ten minutes to the hower; I"
26135 "shall be carrying a _Lloyd's_ in my right hand.  I brings him along,\""
26135 "continued Mr. Trew exultantly; \"I introduces him as a young personal"
26135 "friend of mine that I met on the steamer going to Clacton, year before"
26135 "last.  Your aunt says at once that any friend of mine is a friend of"
26135 "her'n.  You and him pretend not to know each other, but you gradually"
26135 "become acquainted, and your aunt asks him, at the finish, to look in"
26135 "again.  Does that sound all right, or can you suggest a better plan?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"It's splendid,\" she cried."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I think,\" he continued, \"I shall mention in the course of the evening"
26135 "that his father was the best friend I ever had in the world.  When I"
26135 "was in a slight financial difficulty once, his father--your young man's"
26135 "father, I mean--came to my assistance.  And him not well off neither."
26135 "Turning-point of my life.  But for that help I should, likely enough,"
26135 "have gone down, and down, and down.\"  He looked at her for approval."
26135 "\"What's wrong with that?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"He's a gentleman!\""
26135 ""
26135 "Mr. Trew gazed for a few moments at a baby in a perambulator."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I was born in 'fifty-five, the year of the Crimea War,\" he said"
26135 "deliberately, \"and if my mother had had her way, I sh'd have been"
26135 "christened Sebastopol, which wouldn't have been any catch to a public"
26135 "man like myself.  If I'm spared till next year, I shall be celebrating"
26135 "my jubilee, and all London will be illuminated, I expect, with military"
26135 "troops lining the streets.  But what I want to tell you, missy, is"
26135 "that, all that time, I've never seen any good resulting from a girl in"
26135 "your position of life becoming friendly with any chap who was"
26135 "considerably above her in regard to what we call social status.  On the"
26135 "other hand, I've seen harm come from it.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"There's going to be none in my case,\" she said quickly."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I know, I know!  I'm perfectly sure of that.  That is to say, I'm"
26135 "absolutely certain that is your view now.  I can't quite explain what"
26135 "I mean to any one of your age and your sex.  If I was a well-educated"
26135 "man\"--here he took off his cap and rubbed the top of his head"
26135 "with the peak--\"I could find words to wrop it up somehow.  The"
26135 "long and the short of it is, you relinquish the idea.  To oblige"
26135 "me\"--persuasively--\"and to gratify your aunt, who's been pretty good to"
26135 "you since you were a child--\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I don't forget that.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"--And for your own peace of mind in the future, give it all up, and"

26135 "talk about breaking down the barriers that divide one class from"
26135 "another, but, I tell you, it's a job that wants very careful handling."
26135 "And I've got as much sense as most, and I rather enjoy interfering with"
26135 "other people's affairs, but this is an undertaking I don't care to"

26135 "not so dusty, earning twenty-five shillings a week, and with Saturday"
26135 "afternoons and Sundays free; a good home, and everything ready for her"
26135 "when she returned, tired out, at night; first-class feeding, able to"
26135 "dress well.  Mr. Trew, without daring to say whether he was right or"
26135 "whether he was wrong, begged to suggest there were many girls worse"

26135 "heel, closed the door, went inside the tobacco counter, and, across it,"
26135 "spoke rapidly and vehemently, with the aid of emphatic gesture, for"
26135 "five minutes by the clock.  Mr. Trew, disregarding rules of etiquette,"

26135 "Mr. Trew could scarcely be suspected of exceeding his instructions; he"
26135 "had, upon his return, given privately an account of the words used,"
26135 "with frequent use of the phrases, \"I says to him,\" and \"He says to me.\""
26135 "But as evenings of the week went by, and other girls at Hilbert's, on"
26135 "leaving at the hour of seven, were met by courageous youths near the"
26135 "door, and by shyer lads at a more reticent spot (some of these took"
26135 "ambush in doorways, affecting to read cricket results in the evening"

26135 "communicated in the precise tone and manner that she had given it.  The"
26135 "blue pinafored girls, stitching gold thread in the workroom at"
26135 "Hilbert's, cultivated little reserve, and when they had occasion to"
26135 "enter the office they sometimes told her of young men encountered (say)"

26135 "There was encouragement in the thought that he knew the number in Great"
26135 "Titchfield Street; was aware that she walked thence to Praed Street."
26135 "And each evening on the way home a straw hat temporarily imposed upon"
26135 "her, a tall boyish figure and an eager method of walking deceived.  At"
26135 "Praed Street, Mrs. Mills, noting that time had not been wasted on the"
26135 "journey, beamed approval and made much of her niece, telling her she"
26135 "was a good, sensible girl; one bound to get on in the world.  Gertie"
26135 "did not leave again after her arrival, but turned out a room upstairs,"
26135 "and swept and dusted with extraordinary energy."
26135 ""
26135 "Good spirits increased at Great Titchfield Street when Friday came, and"
26135 "men at the looms above sang loudly; girls who had borrowed small sums"
26135 "were reminded by lenders that the moment for payment was close at hand."
26135 "At the hour, wages were given through the pigeon-hole of the windows by"
26135 "Madame, with the assistance of Gertie, and the young women hung up"
26135 "pinafores, pinned hats, and flew off with the sums as though there was"
26135 "danger of a refund being demanded.  When they had gone, Madame,"
26135 "dispirited by the paying out of money, said there was not now the"
26135 "profit in the business that there had been in her father's day, when"
26135 "you charged what you liked, and everybody paid willingly.  To restore"
26135 "cheerfulness, the two faced each other at the sloping desks, and Madame"
26135 "dictated whilst Gertie took bills, headed \"Hilbert's Military"
26135 "Accoutrement Manufacturers,\" and wrote the words, \"To a/c rendered.\""

26135 "Near the print shop over the way, a tall young figure in a tweed suit"
26135 "marched from one unlighted lamp-post to another; the girl drew back to"
26135 "the staircase, snatching a space for consideration.  The next moment"
26135 "she was crossing the street with the air of an art patron anxious to"
26135 "inspect before making a purchase."
26135 ""
26135 "\"You gave me such a start,\" she declared, as a hand touched her"

26135 "decide near to Wells Street that it would be more convenient to fall"
26135 "back on individual methods.  At the corner of Tottenham Court Road"
26135 "Gertie hailed a yellow omnibus which was on the point of starting; she"
26135 "skipped up the steps with a confidence that made the conductor's"
26135 "warning \"'Old tight!\" superfluous."

26135 "\"You didn't mind my sending out that message the other evening?\""

26135 "time fares to the Adelaide were paid.  A man on the seat in front"
26135 "turned to ask her companion for a match; he handed over a silver box"
26135 "that bore a monogram.  She begged permission, when it was given back,"
26135 "to look at the case."

26135 "\"Which stands for the Christian name?\""

26135 "Marylebone Road.  And was it not wonderful how fresh and bracing the"
26135 "air seemed up here, even on a summer's evening; you could easily"
26135 "imagine yourself miles and miles away from London.  Did he care for the"
26135 "country?  She did not.  For one thing, the people there had such an odd"
26135 "way of speaking that it was a trouble to realize what they were driving"

26135 "seated near a tree attracted her notice; the girl's eyes were closed,"
26135 "head resting on the shoulder of the young man, who had an aspect of"
26135 "gloomy resignation."

26135 "\"Sillies some people make of themselves, don't they?\" she said."

26135 "There could be no doubt, as she progressed with the description of"
26135 "Great Titchfield Street, that her mind was well occupied with the daily"
26135 "work; she gave the recital clearly and well, avoiding repetition and"
26135 "excluding any suggestion of monotony.  Every moment of the hours there"
26135 "seemed to engage her interest.  It was her duty to keep the books, and"
26135 "keep them straight; to answer the telephone, and sometimes make"
26135 "purchases of reels of gold thread and of leather.  The looms and the"
26135 "netting machine were worked by men; the rest was done by girls.  The"
26135 "forewoman was described, and her domestic troubles lightly sketched"
26135 "(Miss Rabbit's father backed horses, excepting when they came in"
26135 "first).  Madame herself was spoken of in lowered respectful"
26135 "tones--partly because of her high position, partly because of shrewd"
26135 "and businesslike methods.  Madame, it appeared, attributed any success"
26135 "she attained to the circumstance that she had steered clear of"
26135 "matrimony.  Madame told the girls sometimes that you could wed yourself"
26135 "to business, or you could wed yourself to a man, but women who tried to"
26135 "do both found themselves punished for bigamy, sooner or later.  Gertie"
26135 "was a favourite of Madame's; the main reason was, the girl thought,"

26135 "little 'un!\"  They arrived together at the gate, where Gertie had to"
26135 "rest for a few moments to regain breath.  She pointed out that skirts"

26135 "\"I know,\" agreed Mrs. Mills.  \"Only Gertie hasn't many friends, and I"
26135 "want her, just now, to make the most of 'em.\""
26135 ""
26135 "She called her niece, and Gertie came, turning the page of a book,"
26135 "entitled, \"Hints for Gentlewomen.\"  Gertie offered her hand to Bulpert,"
26135 "and remarked that he was growing stout; he advised her, with some"
26135 "vehemence, to take to glasses before her eyesight became further"
26135 "impaired.  Mrs. Mills went back to the shop with a waggish caution"
26135 "against too much love-making.  Bulpert, after shifting furniture, took"
26135 "up a position on the white hearthrug, and gave a stirring adventure in"
26135 "the life of a coastguardsman who saved from a wreck his wife and child."
26135 "At the end, Bulpert mopped face, readjusted collar, and waited for"
26135 "congratulations."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Did you make it up out your own head, Mr. Bulpert?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I did not make it up out of my own head,\" he said resentfully.  \"That"
26135 "isn't my line, and well you know it.  It was written by a chap your"
26135 "cousin, Clarence Mills, introduced me to.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Ask him to write it again.  It seems to me a stupid piece.  The wife's"
26135 "been away for ten years, and the baby is eighteen months old.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"That does require a slight alteration.  But what about my rendering of"
26135 "it?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Overdone,\" answered Gertie.  \"If only you'd stand up and say them"
26135 "quietly, your pieces would go a lot better.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"But I've got to convey the meaning to the ordience.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Give 'em credit for some intelligence.  When the coastguardsman is"
26135 "going out to the wreck, it isn't necessary to wave your arms about like"
26135 "a windmill.  You say he's swimming, and that's enough.  And if a"
26135 "floating spar knocked him senseless before he got to the wreck, I don't"
26135 "believe he could take them both in his arms and swim back to the shore.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"It says he did in the poetry,\" contended Bulpert with warmth.  \"The"
26135 "whole fact of the matter is that you don't in the least know what"
26135 "you're talking about.\"  A sound of voices came from the shop, and"
26135 "Gertie flushed.  \"Now it's no use your getting hot-tempered about it,\""
26135 "he went on.  \"You speak your mind to me, and I'm entitled to speak my"
26135 "mind to you.  What you suffer from is nothing more nor less than sheer"
26135 "ignorance.  Imperfect education; that's what the complaint is called.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Gertie!\"  A call from the shop."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Yes, aunt.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Do come here just a moment.  Here's the strangest coincidence I ever"
26135 "came across.\"  Gertie obeyed with signs of nervousness.  \"This young"
26135 "gentleman tells me that he knows Ewelme, and he's actually been inside"
26135 "the house where I was born!\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"How do you do?\" said Gertie."
26135 ""
26135 "\"And he's going down there again shortly,\" went on Mrs. Mills with"
26135 "animation, \"and he means to bring me back some roses from the garden."
26135 "Isn't it good of him?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Your daughter is fond of flowers?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"She's only my niece,\" explained Mrs. Mills volubly.  \"Her mother"
26135 "kicked the bucket some years ago, and her father--What's Wallingford"
26135 "like now, sir?  I've said over and over again that I'd one day take the"
26135 "Great Western to go and have a look and see what alterations had been"
26135 "made.  But,\" regretfully, \"it's never been anything more than talk."
26135 "I'd like Gertie to see the place though, so that she could tell whether"
26135 "it comes up to my description.\""
26135 ""
26135 "He seemed inclined to make an impetuous offer, but a brief shake of the"
26135 "girl's head arrested him.  A boy entered and asked for an evening"
26135 "newspaper, and Gertie attended to the transaction."
26135 ""
26135 "\"By the bye,\" turning to the stationery counter, \"I want one or two"
26135 "magazines.\"  Their heads came closely together as a selection was being"
26135 "made; she whispered a caution not to stay too long.  In a louder voice,"
26135 "Gertie announced that the total cost was two shillings and sixpence."
26135 "Mrs. Mills beamed across from the tobacco counter, and asked whether he"
26135 "knew who was keeping \"The Lamb\"; Henry Douglass could not supply the"
26135 "information, but guaranteed to obtain particulars, and bring them to"
26135 "Praed Street.  Mrs. Mills declared herself ashamed to give so much"
26135 "trouble."

26135 "\"I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, sir.  Daresay you know me by"
26135 "name.\"  He found a card in his letter-case, and Henry took it near the"
26135 "light to examine the wording."
26135 ""
26135 "\"'Fred W. Bulpert,'\" he read.  \"'Society Entertainer and Elocutionist.'\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"That's in the evenings, of course,\" said Bulpert.  \"By day, I'm in the"
26135 "West Central district.  Post Office, to tell you the truth.  I'll"
26135 "trouble you for the card back, because I'm running somewhat short of"
26135 "them.  And if you should be arranging a concert at any time, either for"
26135 "your own benefit or any body else's, you might bear me in mind.  F. W."
26135 "B. is a great draw, if I may say so, because, you see, a lot of people"
26135 "have heard him before.\""
26135 ""
26135 "The customer asked whether there was an underground station near; Mrs."
26135 "Mills instructed Gertie to walk along with the young gentleman, and to"

26135 "his promise concerning the roses."

26135 "\"Nice, quiet-spoken lad,\" she commented.  \"I wish Gertie would take up"

26135 "Mr. Trew, off duty, and carrying his whip, came to Praed Street late on"
26135 "a Saturday night, and his look of anxiety disappeared at once when he"
26135 "saw that Mrs. Mills and her niece were on excellent terms with each"
26135 "other.  He explained that there was no time to spare, because his old"
26135 "landlady had a hot supper ready, and it was not wise, on these"
26135 "occasions, to keep her or the meal waiting.  He delivered his news."
26135 "Pleasant, elderly gent on the front seat started conversation by"
26135 "talking about prison life, and Trew gave some particulars of a case"
26135 "with which he was acquainted.  One subject leading to another, the gent"
26135 "said, as the omnibus was crossing Oxford Street, \"Driver, do you ever"
26135 "go to the Zoological Gardens on a Sunday afternoon?\" and thereupon"
26135 "handed over the two tickets, expressing a hope that the visit would be"
26135 "enjoyed by the other and his wife."

26135 "\"And me being nothing more than a lonely bachelor,\" said Trew, \"I"
26135 "thought perhaps the little missy here might favour me with her company.\""

26135 "\"It'll do her the world of good,\" declared Mrs. Mills."
26135 ""
26135 "They met the next day near the West Entrance at half-past three.  Mr."
26135 "Trew, arriving early, had been listening to oratory at different"
26135 "groups, and he mentioned to Gertie that in his opinion some of the"
26135 "speakers might well be transferred to the Gardens, and kept in a cage;"
26135 "what he failed to understand was why people could not set to and make"
26135 "the best of the world, instead of pretending it was all bad.  They went"
26135 "through the turnstiles, and divided attention between animals and"
26135 "visitors; the former could be identified with the help of labels.  Mr."
26135 "Trew said, in regard to the people, that it was difficult to tell which"
26135 "were housemaids, and which were ladies of title."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Oddly enough,\" remarked Gertie, \"I was intending to be here this"
26135 "afternoon, in any case.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Trust me,\" he said, self-reproach fully, \"for coming in second.  Never"
26135 "actually won a race in my life yet.  Is it the same young feller?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I'm not one to chop and change.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"When we run across him, I'll make myself scarce.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"You'll do nothing of the kind, Mr. Trew.\""
26135 ""
26135 "He pointed out, in the crocodile house, one or two regular customers of"
26135 "the Baker Street to Victoria route, and when they recognized him he"
26135 "became purple with content.  A short youth was making notes near a tank"
26135 "in the corner.  Mr. Trew, nudging Gertie, went to him and, in a gruff"
26135 "voice, asked what the deuce he was doing there; the youth turned to"
26135 "give a retort."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I've got your young lady cousin with me,\" explained Mr. Trew.  \"Come"
26135 "along, and help with the task of looking after her.\""

26135 "Clarence Mills was pleased to meet Gertie, and, as the three went"
26135 "towards the red-bricked lions' house, mentioned that he proposed to"
26135 "write a dialogue sketch of the Zoo; up to the present little worth"
26135 "recording had been overheard, and he expected he would, as usual, be"
26135 "compelled to invent the conversations."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I read all of yours, Clarence, that appear in the newspapers,\" said"

26135 "\"Don't you go losing 'eart,\" advised Mr. Trew.  \"I shouldn't be in the"
26135 "position I occupy now if I hadn't made up my mind, from the start, not"
26135 "to get low-spirited.  If any disappointments come your way, simply"
26135 "laugh at 'em.  They can stand anything but that.  Who is this I see on"
26135 "the far horizon?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Don't let him catch sight of us just yet,\" begged the girl"
26135 "apprehensively.  \"He seems to have ladies with him.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Henry's companions entered the house, as the roaring within became"
26135 "insistent, and he looked up and down eagerly.  Gertie gave a whistle."
26135 ""
26135 "\"You and I have met before,\" he said smilingly to Mr. Trew."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I was a Boy Messenger then, sir.\""

26135 "Gertie introduced her cousin with a touch of pride."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I am trying to think,\" said Clarence, \"where I saw your name to-day.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Haven't made a name yet,\" remarked Henry.  \"Only been at it for about"
26135 "eighteen months.  I say!  We don't want to go into that enormous crowd."
26135 "We'll stroll round and see how the penguins are getting on.  They"
26135 "sometimes look as though they were thinking of giving me a commission"
26135 "to draw up plans for new Law Courts.\""
26135 ""
26135 "At one of the open windows the two ladies were standing, watching over"
26135 "many heads the high tea that was being served to the impatient animals."
26135 "The younger one happened to turn as Gertie and her friends went by; she"
26135 "raised her eyebrows."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Everybody one knows appears to be here,\" said Henry Douglass.  \"I wish"
26135 "you had agreed instead to run out with me from Baker Street Station"
26135 "into the country.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Can't do that yet,\" she answered definitely.  \"Not until we know each"
26135 "other a great deal better.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Your rules of conduct are precise.\""

26135 "\"You'll like me all the better later on,\" said Gertie, \"because of"
26135 "that.  Always supposing,\" she continued, \"that you do go on liking me.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"So far as I can gather,\" he remarked good-temperedly, \"I am _persona"

26135 ""
26135 "\"I don't know what that means,\" she said; \"but aunt has quite taken to"
26135 "you.  Just look at this!  Isn't it extr'ordinary?--Clarence,\" she"
26135 "called over her shoulder to her cousin, \"here is most likely where you"
26135 "saw the name this afternoon.\""
26135 ""
26135 "She examined the inscription framed on the bars.  \"Presented to the"
26135 "Society by Sir Mark Douglass.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"No,\" said Clarence Mills.  \"That wasn't it.  My sluggish memory will"

26135 "intelligence.\""

26135 "They were looking down from the terrace at the white bear in his pit,"
26135 "when a high voice came above the moderate tones of the crowd; Henry"
26135 "took Gertie's arm, and began to talk rapidly of Nansen and the North"
26135 "Pole, but this did not prevent her from glancing over her shoulder."
26135 "The people gave way to the owner of the insistent voice, and she, after"
26135 "inspection through pince-nez, made bitter complaint of the clumsiness"
26135 "of the bear, his murky appearance, the serious consequences of"
26135 "indiscriminate feeding.  Henry endeavoured to detach the members of his"
26135 "party, but they appeared enthralled by the commanding tones."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I thought we should meet again,\" said the younger woman, addressing"
26135 "Henry."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Miss Loriner,\" he said to Gertie, with signs of reluctance.  \"A friend"

26135 ""
26135 "\"She seems ratty about something,\" said Gertie."
26135 ""
26135 "\"She has what they call the critical faculty,\" mentioned the other,"
26135 "with a twinkle of the eye.  \"I happen to be aware of the fact.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Lady Douglass was looking around with the air of one searching for"
26135 "fresh subjects; Henry led Gertie to her, and made the introductions."
26135 "Lady Douglass expressed the view that the Gardens were horribly tiring,"
26135 "regretted her ill-luck in visiting on a crowded afternoon.  \"But no"
26135 "misfortune,\" she added wearily, \"seems to escape me!\""
26135 ""
26135 "It was not until they descended the steps that the group had an"
26135 "opportunity for forming itself.  Miss Loriner, recognizing the girl's"
26135 "perturbation of mind, took her ahead, thus foiling the intentions of"
26135 "Lady Douglass; they could hear her talking of literature to Clarence"
26135 "Mills in a patronizing way.  Gertie's cousin said resolutely, \"But"
26135 "George Meredith never wrote a poem with that title.  You are thinking"
26135 "of Owen Meredith.\"  Lady Douglass answered, with pride, that she never"
26135 "troubled to remember the names of authors."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Clarence is standing up to her,\" remarked Gertie."
26135 ""

26135 "\"Wouldn't care for the job myself.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I can't do anything else,\" explained Miss Loriner.  \"Did you say your"
26135 "cousin was a journalist?  I wish I could do something like that.  I"
26135 "want to write a novel, badly.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"That's probably how you would write it.  Why, even Clarence is finding"
26135 "some trouble over the job.  And he's got a brain.\""

26135 ""
26135 "\"Her husband must get precious tired of the sound of her voice.\""
26135 ""

26135 ""
26135 "\"Oh!\"  With illumination.  \"Then you haven't known him long.  They are"

26135 "considerable experience of womankind (including one specimen who, in"
26135 "May of '99, gave him advice on the task of driving horses through"
26135 "London streets), this particular one was, he declared, the limit.  He"
26135 "described himself as feeling bruised, black and blue, all over."
26135 "Without wishing to interfere in matters which did not concern him, he"
26135 "ventured to suggest that Gertie might possibly be fortunate in her"
26135 "young man, but she could scarcely claim to be called lucky in her young"
26135 "man's relations."
26135 ""
26135 "\"I'm going to chuck it,\" she replied desperately.  \"Chuck it"
26135 "altogether.  You were correct in what you said, that Sunday night,"
26135 "about distances, and I was wrong.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Mr. Trew, flustered by this instant agreement, began to hedge.  He did"
26135 "not pretend, he said, to be always right; he could recollect many"
26135 "occasions when he had been considerably wide of the mark.  In fact, a"
26135 "bigger blunderhead, excepting in regard to certain matters, of which"
26135 "this was not one, probably did not exist.  Trew begged to point out"
26135 "that the middle-aged party walking along behind them was, after all,"
26135 "only one middle-aged party, and there was no reason to assume that she"
26135 "could knock out every opponent she encountered.  At the finish of his"
26135 "argument, Trew urged his young companion to put on the gloves, and show"
26135 "what she could do."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Think I had better not,\" she said, less definitely.  \"I shan't like"
26135 "feeling myself beaten, but it's wiser to do that now than to leave it"
26135 "till later.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Mr. Trew became reproachful, almost sarcastic.  This, then, was the"
26135 "stuff that his little friend, niece of his old friend, was made of, was"
26135 "it?  Crumpling up at the first signs of opposition; stepping out of the"
26135 "ring directly her opponent held up fists!  If Gertie represented the"
26135 "young woman of to-day, give Mr. Trew the young woman of thirty years"
26135 "ago.  He had changed his mind recently on an important subject--a thing"
26135 "he rarely did--and half decided to extend the power of voting to the"
26135 "other sex, but the present case induced him to believe first thoughts"

26135 "advance; this did not come.  Miss Loriner, at the command of Lady"
26135 "Douglass, furnished the hour, and a scream of dismay was given,"
26135 "followed by the issuing of orders.  Henry must conduct them out of this"
26135 "dreadful Park; Henry must find a hansom with a reliable horse, and a"

26135 "and take her on to a tea appointment at Cadogan Gardens, thus saving"
26135 "trouble to Lady Douglass, who was really so fagged and wearied by this"
26135 "exhausting afternoon that rest, in a partially darkened room, was"
26135 "nothing short of imperative."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Yes,\" said Gertie, answering Henry's questioning look; \"you go!\""

26135 "Lady Douglass remembered to give a word of farewell when she was a"
26135 "distance of about ten yards away.  \"So pleased to have met you!\" she"
26135 "said casually.  Henry, near the gates, turned and waved his hand, and"
26135 "Gertie responded cheerfully."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Now I want to scream!\" she said."
26135 ""
26135 "Clarence Mills declared his intention of providing tea, and Trew"
26135 "admitted a cup or so would not be likely to prove injurious to the"

26135 "an enamelled table on the lawn, and directly Gertie took the handle of"
26135 "the teapot she was able to announce that she felt considerably improved"
26135 "in temper.  Her cousin gave an imitation of Lady Douglass's speech and"
26135 "manner, and Gertie imitated the imitation.  Mr. Trew had a difficulty"
26135 "in deciding which was the more admirable, but asserted either was to be"
26135 "preferred to the original, and during the progress of the shilling meal"
26135 "they affected to be distinguished members of society, to the great"
26135 "astonishment of folk at neighbouring tables, and to the diversion of an"
26135 "interested waiter.  Completely restored now to her normal mood, Gertie"
26135 "mentioned a number of alert repartees which she would have made if"
26135 "Henry's sister-in-law had given suitable openings."

26135 "\"He said she was going to invite me to her house in the country, but"

26135 "He warned them, in ascending the steps, that he was going to have a"
26135 "rare lark with the driver, whose face, it appeared, was new on the"
26135 "road.  They took seats in front, and Mr. Trew, adopting a rustic"
26135 "accent, inquired of the driver whether the canal below represented the"
26135 "river Thames; in regard to Trinity Church, near Portland Road Station,"
26135 "he asked if he was right in assuming this to be St. Paul's; at Peter"
26135 "Robinson's he put another question, and, information given, demanded"
26135 "whether Oxford Circus was being run by Barnum.  These and other"
26135 "inquiries were courteously replied to; and when the three alighted near"
26135 "the fountain and Trew, looking up, thanked the new driver for his"
26135 "kindness, the driver said, \"Ta-ta, old True till Death,\" whipping the"
26135 "omnibus on the near side to call the conductor's attention to an"
26135 "approaching customer."

26135 "Mr. Trew, depressed by the failure of his elaborate scheme, walked"

26135 "Madame Hilbert and the forewoman in Great Titchfield Street consulted"
26135 "each other only when crises occurred; the girls knew that if Madame"
26135 "came to the doorway, saying, \"Miss Rabbit, just half a second, please,\""
26135 "and the forewoman was absent for half an hour, then some matter of"
26135 "supreme importance was being discussed.  The establishment was in close"
26135 "touch with the military service at home and abroad, and the best stroke"
26135 "good fortune could make in favour of Hilbert's was to arrange a stately"
26135 "ceremonial in India, some alteration in the dress of officers, or"
26135 "anything that made uniforms necessary.  The girls' workroom, even at"
26135 "ordinary times, presented an aspect of enormous wealth, with everywhere"
26135 "a display of gold--loose threads of it on the tables, collected threads"
26135 "being sewn on foundations, epaulettes in course of making, heavy"
26135 "dependent nuggets hung upon scarves.  Gold floated in the air, and when"
26135 "the sun came through the windows it all looked as though one could play"
26135 "the conjurer, and perform the enchanting trick of making a dash with"
26135 "the hand and secure sovereigns.  Many of the girls wore glasses because"
26135 "continued attention to the glistening colours affected the eyes;"
26135 "sometimes a worker became pale of features, anaemic and depressed, and"
26135 "had to hurry off to the sea-side, and Miss Rabbit referred to this as"
26135 "an act of Providence.  For the most part, the girls were healthy and"
26135 "cheerful, and they had the encouragement of good wages.  Miss Rabbit,"
26135 "it was reported, took home every Saturday two pounds ten shillings; the"
26135 "very youngest assistant made twelve shillings a week."

26135 "\"I do hope,\" said Madame, at a special private conference, \"it doesn't"
26135 "mean she's taking up religion.\"  The forewoman shook her head.  \"I've"
26135 "known cases in my time where it's come on suddenly, and it's thrown a"
26135 "girl clean off her balance.  If it isn't religion it must be love."
26135 "Love has just about the same effect with some of us.  Have you ever"
26135 "been gone on any one, Miss Rabbit?\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"Only to a very moderate extent,\" replied the forewoman precisely."

26135 "about it.\""
26135 ""
26135 "\"I don't like to see one of my girls turn like this all at once,\" said"

26135 "her in your position.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Miss Rabbit's features twitched; she corrected the slip at once by"

26135 ""
26135 "\"How'd it be to call her in, and both of us have a talk to her, and"

26135 "entered the office; announcing the occasion as her birthday, she asked"
26135 "Miss Higham to leave books, and assist in celebrating the event by"
26135 "taking with her a cup of chocolate.  Gertie wanted to reach home early"
26135 "in order to see whether an expected letter had arrived, but the"
26135 "invitation suggested a rare compliment, and, with a stipulation"
26135 "arranging that the hospitality should not exceed the space of twenty"
26135 "minutes, she accepted.  In an A.B.C. shop at the corner, later, Gertie"
26135 "raised her large cup and wished Miss Rabbit many happy returns.  Her"

26135 "\"It's rather serious news, and that's why I think you ought to be told."

26135 "The dramatic announcement over, and the appropriate ejaculation, the"
26135 "correct look of amazement and despair given.  Miss Rabbit warmed to her"
26135 "task, and became voluble; at each new paragraph of her discourse she"
26135 "exacted a fresh guarantee that the information would go no further,"
26135 "that the bond of absolute secrecy should be respected.  Once, she felt"
26135 "it necessary to say that if the other communicated a single word of the"
26135 "confidences to any third party, she, Miss Rabbit, would feel it her"
26135 "duty to haunt Miss Higham to the last hour of her life.  Put briefly,"
26135 "the news came to this.  That Madame was in financial difficulties; that"
26135 "her name and address might be found in the bankruptcy list any coming"
26135 "Wednesday or Saturday; that no one was likely to be stupid enough to"
26135 "take over the business; that the members of the staff, men and girls,"
26135 "would find themselves turned out into a cold, hard world.  The drawback"
26135 "of being connected with a business of a special nature like theirs was"
26135 "that there existed but few of a similar nature, and these were already"
26135 "fully supplied with assistants.  Miss Rabbit herself intended to look"
26135 "out for another berth ere the market became swamped by many"
26135 "applications; with piety, she called attention to a well-known text"
26135 "which said, \"Go thou and do likewise.\"  Outside the A.B.C. shop, Miss"
26135 "Rabbit, in extorting thanks for her generous behaviour, demanded, once"
26135 "more, a promise."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Say it after me,\" she ordered.  \"'I will never utter a single syllable"
26135 "of all this to a solitary living soul.'\"  Her instructions complied"
26135 "with, she remarked that a great load was now taken from her mind, and"

26135 "The girl arrived at Praed Street after a brisk walk that was intended"
26135 "to detach the mind from disturbing incident.  In the broad thoroughfare"
26135 "of Portland Place (which looked as though it started with the idea of"
26135 "being a long, important roadway to the north, and became suddenly"
26135 "reminded, to its great astonishment, that Regent's Park barred the way)"
26135 "she had glanced up at the large houses, and wished she lived in one; in"
26135 "that case she would receive Henry Douglass, at the end of the silence"
26135 "that had come since the last meeting, and after listening to him,"
26135 "reject his advances haughtily.  That was the phrase.  Reject his"
26135 "advances haughtily.  She had read it more than once in the literature"
26135 "which attracted her in the days before Henry.  Since she had known him,"
26135 "a course of reading, adopted at his suggestion, took her away from the"
26135 "more flowery and romantic pages, but in the old serial stories the folk"
26135 "had nothing to do but to make love to each other, with intervals for"
26135 "meals and rest; they were not restricted to evening hours; the whole"
26135 "day was at their service.  And certainly the ladies never found"

26135 "on wide grass borders of the road.  At the cross-roads she went to the"

26135 "Outside the station, Miss Loriner was talking to a horse that seemed"
26135 "impatient to make its way in the direction of home; she and Clarence"
26135 "took seats at the back of the dogcart with a light rug spread over"
26135 "knees; they made no complaint of overcrowding."

26135 "were; stopped at one shop to take a parcel of wools intended for his"

26135 "residence was a solid building of fair extent with a parapet wall of"
26135 "stone in front, broad steps leading to the open doors.  On the lawn tea"
26135 "was being set out by a man-servant; he lighted the wick underneath a"
26135 "silver kettle.  Lady Douglass, in black, made an effective entrance"
26135 "down the steps in the company of a dog that looked like a rat."

26135 "for and obtained particulars concerning tastes, Clarence Mills came,"
26135 "and his presence seemed to upset all the table plans; Mrs. Douglass"
26135 "arrested her action as she started to pour tea into the sugar basin."
26135 "The arrival of Miss Loriner enabled her to resign the position.  Going"
26135 "across to sit beside Gertie, she gave a highly interesting account of"
26135 "the way in which she had by sheer force of will conquered the cigarette"

26135 "special circumstances provided an excuse."

26135 "Higham?  It's a ridiculous hour, I know, but we must be at the hall"
26135 "sharp by eight.  Miss Loriner will show you your room when you are"

26135 "When Jim Langham joined the party and sat on the grass beside Miss"
26135 "Higham's chair, the girl rose, and Miss Loriner conducted her into the"
26135 "house; Henry regarded them with a cheerful smile as they left.  The"
26135 "doors gave entrance to a square hall, with a broad staircase going up"
26135 "and turning suddenly to an open corridor that went around three sides."

26135 "\"So Mr. Henry explained to me; and because he was so very good as to"

26135 "along in, and let us have a talk.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Miss Loriner had a good deal to say, mainly in describing her present"
26135 "happiness.  Clarence was a dear; Clarence was a clever dear, Clarence"
26135 "had brought a joy into her life that had previously been absent."
26135 "Hitherto Miss Loriner, living in houses as a companion to some testy"
26135 "and difficult woman, found herself only annoyed by the attentions of"
26135 "men of the Jim Langham type; it was new and enchanting to be approached"
26135 "courteously.  Gertie, when the other stopped to regain breath, managed"
26135 "to ask how Henry Douglass filled his time, and was surprised, and"
26135 "partially hurt, to discover that he still went up to Old Quebec Street"
26135 "on five days of the week."
26135 ""
26135 "\"He might have called at the shop,\" she argued."
26135 ""
26135 "Miss Loriner, for the defence, commended him for his industry.  Henry"
26135 "would, later, have to face the alternative of either giving up his"
26135 "office in London, or relinquishing duties in the country, but at"
26135 "present he was engaged in a double task; and if Gertie appreciated how"
26135 "difficult it proved to deal with Lady Douglass, she would not utter a"
26135 "word of blame in regard to Henry.  One of Lady Douglass's inconvenient"
26135 "tricks was to shift responsibility.  As a case in point, take the"
26135 "entertainment to which they were going that evening.  Lady Douglass,"
26135 "having promised to organize it, had done not a single thing in the way"
26135 "of--"
26135 ""
26135 "\"Is the place on fire?\" asked Gertie, startled."
26135 ""
26135 "\"That's the first warning for dinner.  You have twenty minutes to"
26135 "dress.  Be sure to let me know if there is anything you want.\""
26135 ""
26135 "Gertie left, to return immediately with a concerned expression and the"
26135 "announcement that her portmanteau had been robbed of every blessed"
26135 "thing it contained.  Miss Loriner accompanied her to make"
26135 "investigations, and, switching on the electric light, pointed out that"
26135 "the maid had unpacked the bag--the articles were on the dressing-table,"
26135 "and hanging up in the wardrobe.  Gertie had only to ring, and the maid"
26135 "would come at once to help her to dress.  Gertie said she had done this"
26135 "without assistance since the age of three."
26135 ""
26135 "Apologies were made later for the brevity of the evening meal, but it"
26135 "seemed to her a dinner that could only be eaten by folk who had starved"
26135 "for weeks.  Her cousin sat opposite, and she watched his methods as"
26135 "each course arrived; envied the composure with which Clarence dealt"
26135 "with such trying dishes as _vol au vent_ and artichokes.  Her serviette"
26135 "was of a larkish disposition, declining to remain on her lap, and"
26135 "distress increased each time that Henry recovered it; generally, at"
26135 "these moments of confusion, Lady Douglass took the opportunity to send"
26135 "down some perplexing inquiry, and the girl felt grateful to Henry for"
26135 "replying on her behalf.  Henry, it appeared, was to contribute to the"
26135 "programme at the hall, but he declined to give particulars; the"
26135 "disaster would, he said, be serious enough when it came.  Jim Langham"
26135 "excused himself after dinner from joining the party on the grounds that"
26135 "he had to play billiards with the groom; and this reminded him of one"
26135 "of the groom's stories which (taking her aside) he thought Miss Higham"
26135 "as a Londoner would relish.  The anecdote was but half told when Miss"
26135 "Higham turned abruptly."

26135 "smile at country costumes, felt depressed by their magnificence.  In"
26135 "the front row Lady Douglass stood up, nodded, gave brief ingratiating"
26135 "smiles, and told people how remarkably well they were looking.  Gertie,"
26135 "comforted by the near presence of her cousin, glanced over her"
26135 "shoulder, and wished she were with the shilling folk."
26135 ""
26135 "\"Care to see the programme, Gertie?\""

26135 "than fifteen minutes deeply in love with the lady of the hammock.  \"And"
26135 "if I promise to worship you all my life, will you then give me my"

26135 "The bearded man was leaving when the lady bethought herself to inquire"

26135 "well-known African explorer; and after a few more words the curtain"
26135 "came down on an affianced couple, with applause from all parts of the"
26135 "hall."

26135 "\"Easy enough,\" said Gertie, in ceasing to clap hands, \"for troubles to"

26135 "Lady Douglass accepted congratulations upon the success of her"

26135 "request Gertie's attention for a moment.  She was extremely anxious"
26135 "that her dear young brother-in-law should not commit an error that"
26135 "might last a lifetime.  Apparently there was some one up in town who"
26135 "had managed to engage his affections: Lady Douglass did not know her;"
26135 "Miss Higham, of course, had not her acquaintance.  The young woman, she"
26135 "believed, occupied an inferior position in life, and Lady Douglass"
26135 "would dearly like to have the opportunity of pointing out that"
26135 "supposing the two married, all the stories of ill-bred wives would be"
26135 "fastened upon Mrs. Henry Douglass.  Every night, in every"
26135 "billiard-room, in every smoking-room in Berkshire, amusing stories, not"
26135 "always true, would be told of her mistakes; dull folk might find"
26135 "themselves reckoned as humorists by inventing anecdotes about her, and"

26135 "this to be said.  Supposing--"

26135 "could not expect to be ruled by office hours; you had to wait until"
26135 "inspiration came, and then the light was, perhaps, not exactly what you"

26135 "account of some affection of the heart, but an uncommonly good talker."
26135 "When human intercourse failed she addressed articles of furniture,"
26135 "asking them how much they cost originally, and, sarcastically, whether"
26135 "they were under the impression that they looked as good as new; to some"
26135 "she gave the assurance that if she were to meet them at a jumble sale,"
26135 "she would pass by without a second glance.  The charwoman suggested, at"
26135 "the completion of her task, and rolling up her square mat with the care"
26135 "of one belonging to an Oriental sect, that her help should be engaged"

26135 "of more active methods and of less years would be approached."

26135 "Miss Radford came early, excusing herself for this breach of decorum on"
26135 "the grounds that it made her painfully nervous to enter a room when"
26135 "strangers were present; apart from which, to arrive in good time meant"
26135 "that one had a chance of looking at oneself in the mirror.  Did Gertie"
26135 "consider that her (Miss Radford's) complexion was showing signs of"
26135 "going off?  A lady friend, who, from the description given, seemed to"
26135 "be neither a friend nor a lady, had mentioned that Miss Radford was"
26135 "beginning to look her full age; and remarks of this kind might be"
26135 "contradicted but could not be ignored."

26135 "Clarence came with Miss Loriner, and the young hostess flushed at the"
26135 "young woman's first words.  Henry sent his best regards.  Henry, it"
26135 "appeared, no longer spent week-ends at Ewelme--this because of some"
26135 "want of agreement with Lady Douglass; and he was now busy in connection"
26135 "with a sanatorium at Walton-on-Naze, which demanded frequent journeys"
26135 "from Liverpool Street.  Gertie, in taking Miss Loriner to get rid of"
26135 "hat and dust-cloak in the adjoining room, felt it good to find herself"
26135 "remembered.  Miss Loriner wanted a small fan, and searching the"

26135 "enlightened."

26135 "\"I've brought Lady Douglass's bag by mistake,\"  she cried,"
26135 "self-reproachfully.  \"Here are her initials in the corner--'M. D.'; not"

26135 "Frederick Bulpert, arriving with his friends, asserted his position by"
26135 "attempting to kiss Gertie; she drew back, and Bulpert said manfully"
26135 "that if she could do without it he could also afford to dispense with"
26135 "the ceremony.  He introduced his companions as two of the very best and"
26135 "brightest, and they intimated, by a modest shrug of the shoulders, that"
26135 "this might be taken as a correct description.  The sisters of"
26135 "Westbourne Grove came bearing a highly-ornamental cardboard case with a"
26135 "decoration of angels, and containing a pair of gloves.  They mentioned"
26135 "that if the size was not correct the gloves could be changed, and at"
26135 "once took seats in the corner of the room, whence they surveyed the"
26135 "company with a critical air, sighing in unison, as though regretting"
26135 "deeply their mad impulsiveness in accepting the invitation.  On this,"
26135 "other presents were offered; Bulpert said his memento would come later"
26135 "on.  One of his friends sat on the music-stool, and Sarah, the"
26135 "charwoman's daughter, entering at the first chord with a tray that held"
26135 "sandwiches and cakes, said to him casually, \"Hullo, George, you on in"
26135 "this scene?\" and handed around the refreshments.  Bulpert's friend,"
26135 "disturbed by the incident, waited until the girl left the room, and"
26135 "then explained that he had met her in pantomime, the previous"
26135 "Christmas, at the West London Theatre; he argued forcibly that people"
26135 "encountered behind the footlights had no right to claim acquaintance"
26135 "outside.  \"Otherwise,\" contended Bulpert's friend, \"we're none of us"
26135 "safe.\"  He was induced to give his song, and the first lines,--"
26135 ""
26135 "  \"I went to Margate, once I did, to spend my holidee,"
26135 "  Such funny things you seem to see beside the silver sea\""
26135 ""
26135 "suggested that he was not one disposed to worship originality or make a"
26135 "fetish of invention.  Bulpert, at the end, pointed out that his friend"
26135 "had omitted the last verse; the man at the pianoforte said there were"
26135 "some places where he was in the habit of giving the last verse; this,"
26135 "he declared flatteringly, was not one of them.  Gertie's aunt came"
26135 "upstairs to announce that, the occasion being special, she had taken it"
26135 "upon herself to put up the shutters.  If they excused her for half a"
26135 "second this would give her sufficient space to tittivate and smarten up."

26135 "Clarence Mills.  Clarence scored an immediate success.  The sisters, it"
26135 "seemed, prided themselves upon being tremendous readers; Clarence was"
26135 "acquainted with some of the writers who, to them, were only names.  And"
26135 "the young hostess would have been able to survey the room with"
26135 "contentment, but for the fact that Miss Radford suddenly became"
26135 "depressed--with hands clasped over a knee she rocked to and fro in her"

26135 "terrifying thought that no one loved her, nobody cared for her, and for"
26135 "all practical purposes Miss Radford might as well be dead and buried,"
26135 "with daisies growing over her grave.  Gertie argued against this"

26135 "swallowed cards, and produced them with a slight click from his elbow,"
26135 "the middle of his back, and his ankle.  He allowed Miss Loriner to find"
26135 "the four aces and put them at the bottom of the pack, and the next"

26135 "Trew, after denying the suggestion that he had come prepared to play"
26135 "whist, admitted the young man was a masterpiece.  Mr. Trew's watch was"
26135 "next borrowed and wrapped in paper; the poker borrowed in order to"
26135 "smash it; the violent blow given.  Miss Radford was asked to be so very"
26135 "kind as to assist by looking in the plate of nuts that stood on the"
26135 "table, and there the watch was discovered, safe and sound.  Some"
26135 "thought-reading followed, not easy to understand because of the"
26135 "incessant monologue kept up by the gifted youth; but the results were"
26135 "satisfactory, and by pressing the folded pieces of paper very hard"

26135 "with docility.)  But news came from Miss Loriner that Lady Douglass,"
26135 "after years of the luxury of imagining herself in delicate health, was"
26135 "now genuinely ill, and Henry went down from town each evening by a late"

26135 "Gertie's escort had a pair of driving-gloves, and he could not"
26135 "determine whether it looked more aristocratic to wear these or to carry"
26135 "them with a negligent air; he compromised on the departure platform by"
26135 "wearing one and carrying the other.  The collector-dog trotted up with"

26135 "obtaining at last corroborative evidence from a director.  The girl"
26135 "turned, and, gazing at the rows of books, found she could not read the"
26135 "titles clearly.  One of the lads of the stall came with a book in his"
26135 "hand, recommending it to her notice; written by a new chap, he"

26135 "conversation with a Great Western official; Mr. Trew, in going past,"
26135 "turned and, with a great air of wonder, recognized him.  Gertie noted"
